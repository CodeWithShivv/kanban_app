**Kanban App MVP**

**A Comprehensive Project Management Tool Built with Flutter**

This Kanban app MVP  empowers you to streamline your project management with visual task boards, seamless collaboration, and efficient task organization. Leverage the power of Flutter to create a beautiful and cross-platform experience for your team.

**Key Features:**

-   **Intuitive Kanban boards:** Manage tasks using visually appealing drag-and-drop boards, facilitating clear task organization and flow.
-   **Task management:** A kanban board for tasks, where users can create, edit, and move tasks
between different columns (e.g. "To Do", "In Progress", "Done").

-   **Collaborative environment:** Fosters teamwork with features like task comments and history tracking.
-   **Error reporting:** Implements a robust error handling mechanism to identify and address app issues effectively.
-   **Event tracking:** Tracks user interactions with boards, tasks, and comments using Firebase Analytics for valuable insights.
-   **Firebase integration:** Leverages Firebase for potential authentication, analytics, and database features (implementation details can be customized).
